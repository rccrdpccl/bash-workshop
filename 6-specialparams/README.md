1) Write a bash script that accepts 2 arguments and sums them up.
Example:
```
$ ./sum 1 2
3
```

2) Modify the previous script so that it can accept any number of arguments.
Example:
```
$ ./sum 3 4 5
12
```

3) If there are less then 2 arguments, print usage:
```
Usage: ./sum <arg1> <arg2> [arg3] ... [argN]
```

4) If the script name changes, usage output should also change.
